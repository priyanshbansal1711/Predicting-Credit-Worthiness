# Predicting-Credit-Worthiness
Creditworthiness vital for lenders. Emerging markets like India lack financial history, hindering traditional scoring. Alternative data (mobile, social, transactions) offers a solution to improve accuracy.



This research paper explores the innovative use of alternative data and machine learning
algorithms to predict creditworthiness in emerging markets, with a particular focus on
India. Traditional credit scoring models, which rely heavily on historical financial data, are
often ineffective in these regions due to limited financial histories. By incorporating
alternative data sources and advanced machine learning techniques, this study aims to
enhance the accuracy and inclusivity of credit assessments. The paper also examines the
transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in the credit evaluation landscape in
India.
